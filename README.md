👋 Hi, I'm @pasariboe!

👀 I'm interested in programming, web development, machine learning, and open-source projects.

🌱 I'm currently learning Python for its versatility, JavaScript for its role in web development, PHP for server-side scripting, and exploring the Laravel framework for building robust web applications.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to web development or machine learning.

📫 You can reach me via email at [jojo.x.pasaribu@gmail.com](mailto:jojo.x.pasaribu@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-pasaribu).

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love experimenting with new programming languages and technologies, and I'm always up for a coding challenge!
